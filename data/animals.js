The species exhibits sexual dimorphism; the males and females look different. Males are an average length between 1.8 and 2.4m, with pelvic spurs around their cloaca that are used to facilitate mating. Females are larger, with an average length of between 2.1 and 3m, whilst they have pelvic spurs, they are smaller than the male's.",

White-faced capuchins are between 33 and 45cm in length with a 35 to 55cm long tail, weighing between 1.5 and 4kg. Males are larger and heavier than females.",

They are characterised by several visual features: long, slim and spiral horns; a black face with white markings over the eyes and muzzle; a grey-brown coat with black markings on the upper legs and back; as well as white ‘socks’. On average, Gemsbok stand between 1.1 and 1.3m tall at the shoulder, measure 1.9 to 2.4m long and have an average horn length of 85cm. The males are also slightly larger and significantly heavier than the females.",

      "The greater flamingo (or Phoenicopterus roseus) is a large species of migratory bird that is widespread across Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Africa. It lives on the mudflats and coastal lagoons of temperate and warm environments, and is a filter feeder which uses its beak to stir up mud and filter out algae, invertebrates and seeds. Male and female flamingos look the same with pale-pink to orange-pink feathers, pink legs, a pink beak with a black tip, and often brighter pink patches on their wings. They also have black flight feathers, measure between 110 and 150cm tall, and weigh between 2 and 4kg.",

The species is divided into six subspecies, separated due to different features, usually varying strip patterns, and lack of interbreeding between groups. Plains zebra have the black and white stripes famous of all zebra, but are smaller than Grevy’s zebra and larger than mountain zebra. Males and females can both be 1.10 to 1.45m in height, and between 2.17 and 2.46m in length, although males are generally 10% larger than females.",

      "The reindeer (or Rangifer tarandus) is a species of ungulate that lives throughout the Arctic and Sub Arctic – specifically in Canada, The USA (Alaska), Russia, Norway, Finland and Greenland. A reindeer’s appearance changes depending on their origin and the time of year, but generally they have a brown and white coat, and a face with a white underside and muzzle, often with darker coloration on the snout. They also have large antlers, multiple points of which are covered in brown velvet. The males are between 1.8 and 2.1m long, weighing between 159 and 182kg. Females are between 1.6 and 2.05m long, weighing between 80 and 120kg.",

The reticulated giraffe is distinguishable from other subspecies thanks to its large, polygonal spots, tan to red in colour, that are divided by white interconnecting lines on the animal’s fur. While both sexes are extremely tall, the males are significantly taller than females and have well developed bony horns on their head; the horns of the female are smaller and thinner. Giraffes are famous for their long neck, which is used for accessing leaves that are out of reach to other animals.",

The appearance of timber wolves can vary widely and is mostly dependent on which population is being observed. There are 38 subspecies, each with adaptations to their specific environments, thus causing their varied appearance. In general, they have a mottled grey-brown fur coat, pointed ears and a long straight snout. In terms of size, the wolves have a slim build with a deep rib cage and long legs.",
